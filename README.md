# Gravitas
This side scroller game was developed during a game mechanics course. The original repository existed on a group members' Github. I have since mirrored the original repository over to my own Github.

Execution Instructions:
To run the game, simply run import the Game folder into Unity, then run the main scene.

NOTE:
Due to the age of this project, there may be compatibility issues on newer versions of Unity.
